## Project Title ##
COVID Tracer<br/>


## Project Description ##
The COVID-19 tracer sample site is a sample website that utilizes MySQL, PHP, CSS, and HTML to provide users with a platform for tracking their potential exposure to the COVID-19 virus. The website enables users to input their location and date, and then cross-references this information with a database of known cases in the area. If a match is found, the user will receive a notification that they may have been exposed and should take appropriate measures to get tested and self-isolate.
